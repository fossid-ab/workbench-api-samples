# FossID Workbench API Examples!
These scripts were built by the FossID Customer Experience teams in collaboration with Engineering to solve specific use cases raised by customers via the [FossID Support Portal](https://support.fossid.com/). 

### Supportability
These examples demonstrate how to interact with the Workbench API. We do our best to keep the examples updated, but there is no long-term maintainer for this code. We do not use GitHub Issues - for questions or issues with the scripts please use the [FossID Support Portal](https://support.fossid.com/). Thank you! 

## Example Scripts
The repo has scripts that help you:

### Archive Old Scans
This script helps clients archive stale scans based on when they were last modified.

### Post Scan Gates
This script checks scans for Pending Identifications and Policy Violations - useful for gating CI/CD pipelines.

### Post Scan Reports
This script downloads reports for a scan - useful if you want to include FossID reports as build artifacts.

### Quickly Scan a File
This script scans a single file using the Quick Scan API - helpful for quickly knowing if AI-generated code should be investigated further.

### Import Dependency Analysis
This script imports dependency analysis results to an existing scan - useful for adding dependency analysis results from running ORT or FossID-DA in a pipeline to your scans.
